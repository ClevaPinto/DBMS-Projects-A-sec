Project Description:

The online examination system not only reflects the justiification and objectivity of examination, but also releases the workload of teachers, which is accepted by more and more schools, certification organisations and training organisations. The new online examination system overcomes the shortcoming of old online examination systems and has better extensibility and flexibility.

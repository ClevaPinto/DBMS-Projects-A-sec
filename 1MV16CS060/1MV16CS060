Project definition/ Abstract: 

The online examination system not only reflects the justification and objectivity of examination, but also releases the workload of teachers, which is accepted by more and more schools, certificate organisations and training organisations. The new online examination system overcomes the shortcoming of the ld online examination systems and has better extensibility and flexibility.
